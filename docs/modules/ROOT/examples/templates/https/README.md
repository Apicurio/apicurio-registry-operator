This collection of OpenShift templates provides examples of how to configure Red Hat Integration - Service Registry to use HTTPS. Each template contains comments with instructions and details.

We suggest you read the examples in the following order of increasing complexity:

Edge termination:

- registry-default-edge
- registry-certmanager-edge
- registry-certmanager-letsencrypt-edge
- registry-certmanager-letsencrypt-custom-domain-edge

Passthrough termination:

- registry-snapshot-certmanager-passthrough (only upstream for now, see comments)
