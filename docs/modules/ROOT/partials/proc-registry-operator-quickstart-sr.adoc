= Command-Line {operator} Installation

The recommended installation option for production environments is to use the xref::assembly-installation.adoc[OperatorHub].

However, in order to quickly deploy the {operator} without using link:{LinkOLMDocs}[{NameOLMDocs}], you can download a set of installation files and examples from link:{LinkRedHatIntegrationDownloads}[{NameRedHatIntegrationDownloads}].

. Select the product version and download Service Registry CRDs zip file.

. Create a project for the installation, e.g., `service-registry`:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc new-project service-registry
----

. Set the namespace in `install/cluster_role_binding.yaml` by replacing `+{NAMESPACE}+` with `service-registry`.

. Apply the files located in the `install/` folder:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f install/
----

NOTE: You can find more information in the xref:assembly-installation.adoc[Installation] page.
