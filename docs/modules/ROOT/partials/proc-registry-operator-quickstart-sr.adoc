= Quickstart {operator} installation

You can quickly deploy the {operator} on the command line, without the Operator Lifecycle Manager, by using a downloaded set of installation files and examples.

.Prerequisites

* Go to link:{LinkRedHatIntegrationDownloads}[{NameRedHatIntegrationDownloads}], select the product version, and download the {registry} CRDs `.zip` file.

.Procedure

. Create a project for the installation, for example, `service-registry`:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc new-project service-registry
----

. Set the namespace in `install/cluster_role_binding.yaml` by replacing `+{NAMESPACE}+` with `service-registry`.

. Apply the files located in the `install/` folder:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f install/
----
