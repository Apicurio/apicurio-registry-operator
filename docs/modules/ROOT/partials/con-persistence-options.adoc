= {registry} storage options

The main decision to make when deploying {registry} is which storage backend to use.

The following storage options are available:

ifdef::apicurio-registry[]
* *In-memory* - data is stored in RAM on each {registry} node.
This is the easiest deployment to use, but is not recommended for production environment.
endif::[]
* *Apache Kafka* (Kafka + SQL) - data is stored using Apache Kafka, with the help of local SQL database
on each node.
* *SQL* (PostgreSQL) - data is stored in a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL 12+.

.Storage requiring installation
The following options require that the storage is already installed as a prerequisite:

* *Apache Kafka*
* *SQL* (PostgreSQL)
