= Infinispan Persistence Configuration
:parent: Configuration

Infinispan persistence option uses RAM of the nodes where {registry} is deployed to store the data.
This is achieved using embedded Infinispan in-memory data grid, which also provides data replication between the nodes.
The configuration is simple, the only non-required option is to provide a name for the Infinispan cluster.

Following is the example CR:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apicur.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApicurioRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-apicurioregistry
spec:
  configuration:
    persistence: "infinispan"
    infinispan: # Currently, registry uses an embedded version of Infinispan
      clusterName: "example-apicurioregistry"
      # ^ Optional
----

IMPORTANT: This persistence option is a https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature, and it is currently not suitable for production environments.
