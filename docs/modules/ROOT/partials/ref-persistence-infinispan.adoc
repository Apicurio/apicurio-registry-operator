= Configuring {registry} Infinispan storage
:parent: Configuration

The {registry} Infinispan storage option uses the RAM of the nodes where {registry} is deployed to store the data.
This is achieved using an embedded Infinispan in-memory data grid, which also provides data replication between the nodes. The configuration is simple, with an optional field to provide a name for the Infinispan cluster.

.Procedure
. Use the following example CR:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apicur.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApicurioRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-apicurioregistry
spec:
  configuration:
    persistence: "infinispan"
    infinispan: # Currently, registry uses an embedded version of Infinispan
      clusterName: "example-apicurioregistry"
      # ^ Optional
----

IMPORTANT: The Infinispan storage option is a https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature, and it is currently not suitable for production environments.
