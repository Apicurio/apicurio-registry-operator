= Securing {registry} using the {keycloak} Operator

The following procedure shows how to configure a {registry} REST API and web console to be protected by {keycloak}.

{registry} supports the following user roles:

.{registry} user roles
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
| Name | Capabilities

| `sr-admin`
| Full access, no restrictions.

| `sr-developer`
| Create artifacts and configure artifact rules. Cannot modify global rules, perform import/export, or use `/admin` REST API endpoint.

| `sr-readonly`
| View and search only. Cannot modify artifacts or rules, perform import/export, or use `/admin` REST API endpoint.
|===

NOTE: There is a related configuration option in the `ApicurioRegistry` CRD that you can use to set the web console to read-only mode. However, this configuration does not affect the REST API.

.Prerequisites
* You must have already installed the {operator}.
* You must install the {keycloak} Operator or have {keycloak} accessible from your OpenShift cluster.

IMPORTANT: The example configuration in this procedure is intended for development and testing only. To keep the procedure simple, it does not use HTTPS and other defenses recommended for a production environment. For more details, see the {keycloak} documentation. 


.Procedure
. In the OpenShift web console, click *Installed Operators* and *{keycloak} Operator*, and then the *Keycloak* tab.

. To create the {keycloak} instance, see the https://www.keycloak.org/operator/basic-deployment[Keycloak documentation on how to create a basic deployment].

. When your {keycloak} instance is available, you can import the following example realm by using the steps in the https://www.keycloak.org/operator/realm-import[Keycloak Operator documentation]:

+
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$/keycloak/keycloak_realm.yaml[]
----
+
IMPORTANT: You must customize this `KeycloakRealm` resource with values suitable for your environment if you are deploying to production. You can also create and manage realms using the {keycloak} web console.

. If your cluster does not have a valid HTTPS certificate configured, you can create the following HTTP `Service` and `Ingress` resources as a temporary workaround:

.. Click *Networking* and then *Services*, and click *Create Service* using the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$/keycloak/keycloak_http_service.yaml[]
----
.. Click *Networking* and then *Ingresses*, and click *Create Ingress* using the following example::
+
----    
include::example$/keycloak/keycloak_http_ingress.yaml[]
----
+
Modify the `host` value to create a route accessible for the {registry} user, and use it instead of the HTTPS route created by {keycloak} Operator.

. Click the *{operator}*, and on the *ApicurioRegistry* tab, click *Create ApicurioRegistry*, using the following example, but replace your values in the `keycloak` section.
ifdef::apicurio-registry[]

[source,yaml]

include::example$/keycloak/apicurioregistry_mem_keycloak_cr.yaml[]
