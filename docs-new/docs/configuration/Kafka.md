# Kafka Persistence Configuration
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

This persistence option uses plain Kafka as a storage. 

## Prerequisites

You need to have a Kafka cluster available in your Kubernetes or OpenShift system.

In this tutorial, we will use the [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/) operator to provision Kafka for us. 
It is also available in the [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/strimzi-kafka-operator).
